# Item 10: FormulaEditor Class Refactoring Plan
*Generated: January 1, 2025*
*Updated: January 1, 2025 - Stage 1 Complete*

## 📋 **Overview**

**Target**: FormulaEditor class refactoring (Item 10 from calcforge_refactoring_report.md)
**Current State**: Lines 1132-3283 = **2,151 lines** with too many responsibilities
**Goal**: Extract logical groupings into mixins/separate classes for better maintainability

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

The FormulaEditor class is **massive** with over 2,000 lines and handles multiple responsibilities:
- Text editing and document management
- Auto-completion functionality  
- Cross-sheet reference handling
- Performance monitoring and debugging
- Event handling (mouse, keyboard, resize)
- Text selection and navigation
- Line number management
- Expression evaluation
- Unit conversion handling

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code:
- ❌ Hard to maintain and debug
- ❌ Difficult to unit test
- ❌ Prone to merge conflicts
- ❌ Complex to understand and modify

## 📈 **Progress Tracking**

## 🎯 **STAGE 5 COMPLETION SUMMARY**

**All 5 Planned Stages Successfully Completed!** ✅

The FormulaEditor class refactoring is now **COMPLETE**. The massive 2,000+ line class has been successfully broken down into focused, manageable mixins:

### **Final Architecture**:
```python
class FormulaEditor(QPlainTextEdit, 
                    EditorAutoCompletionMixin,
                    EditorPerformanceMonitoringMixin, 
                    EditorCrossSheetMixin,
