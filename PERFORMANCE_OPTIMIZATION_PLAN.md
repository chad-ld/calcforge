# CalcForge Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

The current CalcForge application experiences 0.5-1 second delays when modifying LN references or function expressions due to several performance bottlenecks. This document outlines a comprehensive optimization strategy broken into stages to improve responsiveness while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified:

1. **Full Sheet Re-evaluation**: Every text change triggers complete sheet recalculation via `evaluate()` method
2. **Inefficient LN Reference Processing**: The `process_ln_refs()` method uses multiple regex passes and iterative replacement
3. **Cross-Sheet Cache Rebuilding**: Cross-sheet caches are rebuilt too frequently during navigation and editing
4. **Excessive Highlighting Operations**: The `highlightCurrentLine()` method processes cross-sheet references even for simple edits
5. **Timer-Based Delays**: Current 300ms evaluation timer adds perceived latency
6. **Redundant Dependency Graph Rebuilds**: The dependency graph is rebuilt on every text change

## Optimization Strategy - 5 Stages

### Stage 1: Smart Change Detection and Evaluation Debouncing
**Target**: Eliminate unnecessary full evaluations
**Risk Level**: Low
**Expected Performance Gain**: 60-70%

**Changes:**
- Implement line-level change detection instead of full-text comparison
- Add intelligent debouncing with shorter delays for simple math expressions
- Skip evaluation when only whitespace or comments change
- Cache evaluation results to avoid recomputing unchanged expressions

### Stage 2: Optimized LN Reference Processing
**Target**: Accelerate LN reference resolution
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium
**Expected Performance Gain**: 40-50%
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Implementation Notes:**
- Pre-compiled regex patterns added to FormulaEditor.__init__()
- Optimized process_ln_refs() method with single-pass replacement
- Added LN reference result caching with automatic cache management
- Cache cleared on each evaluation cycle to ensure consistency
- Fixed tab switching highlighting issue by resetting rapid navigation state
- Added forced highlighting update after tab switch and evaluation

**Changes:**
- Pre-compile regex patterns for LN reference detection
- Implement single-pass LN reference replacement instead of iterative
- Cache LN reference parsing results per line
- Use more efficient string replacement algorithms

### Stage 3: Selective Line Re-evaluation

#### Overview:
**Target**: Only re-evaluate changed lines and their dependents
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Expected Performance Gain**: 70-80%
**Duration**: 2-3 sessions broken into 3 sub-stages

#### Sub-Stage Breakdown:

#### Stage 3.1: Line Dependency Graph Infrastructure
**Focus**: Build the foundation for tracking line-to-line dependencies within sheets
**Duration**: 1 session
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium

**Files to Modify:**
- `calcforge.py` - Worksheet class (new dependency tracking methods)

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Create dependency graph data structures**
   ```python
   def __init__(self):
       # Add to Worksheet.__init__()
       self.line_dependencies = {}  # {line_num: set of lines that depend on it}
       self.line_references = {}    # {line_num: set of lines it references}
       self.dependency_graph_cache = {}  # Cache for expensive lookups
   ```

2. **Implement dependency analysis method**
   ```python
   def build_line_dependencies(self):
       """Analyze all lines to build dependency graph"""
       # Parse each line to find LN references
       # Build bidirectional dependency mapping
       # Track internal sheet references only (not cross-sheet)
   ```

3. **Add incremental dependency updates**
   ```python
   def update_line_dependencies(self, line_number, old_content, new_content):
       """Update dependencies when a single line changes"""
       # Remove old dependencies for this line
       # Parse new content for LN references
       # Update bidirectional mappings efficiently
   ```

4. **Create dependency lookup helpers**
   ```python
   def get_dependent_lines(self, line_number):
       """Get all lines that depend on the given line"""
       # Return cached result if available
       # Traverse dependency graph efficiently
   
   def get_dependency_chain(self, changed_lines):
       """Get complete chain of lines affected by changes"""
       # Use breadth-first search to find all dependents
       # Avoid infinite loops in circular dependencies
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify dependency graph builds correctly for various LN reference patterns
- Test incremental updates when lines change
- Confirm bidirectional mappings are consistent
- Test performance with large sheets (100+ lines)

#### Stage 3.2: Selective Evaluation Engine
**Focus**: Implement the core selective evaluation logic
**Duration**: 1 session
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Files to Modify:**
- `calcforge.py` - Worksheet class evaluation methods

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Create selective evaluation method**
   ```python
   def evaluate_changed_lines_only(self, changed_lines):
       """Only re-evaluate changed lines and their dependents"""
       # Get complete dependency chain
       # Preserve results for unchanged lines
       # Evaluate in dependency order to avoid multiple passes
       # Update only affected result displays
   ```

2. **Implement dependency-aware evaluation order**
   ```python
   def get_evaluation_order(self, lines_to_evaluate):
       """Return lines in dependency-safe evaluation order"""
       # Topological sort of dependency graph
       # Handle circular dependencies gracefully
       # Ensure prerequisites are evaluated first
   ```

3. **Add result preservation mechanism**
   ```python
   def preserve_unchanged_results(self, all_lines, lines_to_evaluate):
       """Keep existing results for lines not being re-evaluated"""
       # Copy existing results for unchanged lines
       # Maintain line-to-result mappings
       # Handle result formatting consistency
   ```

4. **Integrate with existing evaluation pipeline**
   ```python
   def evaluate(self):
       """Enhanced evaluate method with selective option"""
       # Detect if selective evaluation is beneficial
       # Fall back to full evaluation for major changes
       # Maintain compatibility with existing code
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify selective evaluation produces same results as full evaluation
- Test dependency order calculations
- Confirm unchanged lines preserve their results
- Test integration with existing evaluation triggers

#### Stage 3.3: Dependency-Aware Caching System
**Focus**: Optimize caching and result propagation
**Duration**: 1 session
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium

**Files to Modify:**
- `calcforge.py` - Worksheet class caching methods

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Implement dependency-aware result caching**
   ```python
   def cache_line_result_with_dependencies(self, line_number, content, result, dependencies):
       """Cache result with its dependency fingerprint"""
       # Store result with dependency hash
       # Track which lines this result depends on
       # Enable efficient cache invalidation
   ```

2. **Create efficient update propagation**
   ```python
   def update_dependent_lines(self, changed_line, new_value):
       """Efficiently propagate changes to dependent lines"""
       # Update only lines that reference the changed line
       # Use cached dependency mappings
       # Minimize cascading recalculations
       # Batch updates for multiple dependent lines
   ```

3. **Add smart cache invalidation**
   ```python
   def invalidate_dependency_cache(self, changed_lines):
       """Invalidate only relevant cache entries"""
       # Find all cache entries affected by changes
       # Use dependency graph to minimize invalidation
       # Preserve unaffected cached results
   ```

4. **Optimize memory usage and performance**
   ```python
   def cleanup_dependency_caches(self):
       """Clean up unused cache entries and optimize memory"""
       # Remove stale cache entries
       # Compress dependency graph storage
       # Balance memory usage vs. lookup speed
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**

- **Combined**: 70-80% performance improvement for large sheets with dependencies

### Stage 4: Cross-Sheet Optimization Refinements

**Changes:**
- Debounce highlighting operations more aggressively
- Cache highlighting states to avoid redundant calculations
- Optimize visual updates during rapid text changes
